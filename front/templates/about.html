    <p class="aboutparagraph">Every year, a large number of people give entrance examinations, and it is a really tough job to crack the entrance examination. So many of them go to learning institutions where they can be well prepared. Going to an institution at a particular time just wastes time for traveling from home to the institution and again back to home. It may also not be possible for all the people to join an institution who reside far away from the learning institution. So to overcome those drawbacks of the existing old-fashioned system, we require a system that can make the preparation virtually with the help of an app. Entrance Preparation is the online platform that helps to prepare for various entrance exams virtually. It is really a powerful system in which a large number of people can be connected to gain knowledge on the topics of their choice and make them well practice for their entrance. In this system, people can find the past question papers. Also, quizzes and dummy entrance exams can be conducted in this app which builds up confidence for giving a real entrance exam. There is also an evaluation scheme that shows how well he/she is prepared for the entrance exam, and this evaluation is based on their performance in the dummy exams. As this app allows anyone to prepare for the entrance exam from their home at any time, it really saves time and makes the preparation more efficient.</p>
